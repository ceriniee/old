# Development Notes: Dec. 2021 ~ June 2022

Start Date: December 2021

## December 2021 
* I set up the development environment. 
* There were many trials and errors. 
  * First, I tried to work with my local computer (Mac). 
    * My Mac does not have a vram. 
  * So I also tried to work with a Windows computer that has a GPU (RTX 2070 SUPER) and set up a virtual machine (VM). 
    * The Windows desktop had 6 gigabytes of GPU vram, while we needed at least 8-10 gigabytes of GPU vram. 
  * Then, finally, I decided to work with Google Colab as it provided 12+ gigabytes of GPU vram.


## January 2022
* I read through and studied the paper written on [Tri-graph Information Propagation for Polypharmacy Side Effect Prediction (TIP)](https://grlearning.github.io/papers/94.pdf) by Xu, Sang, and Lu.
